  "content": "Families have fewer illnesses when they have an adequate supply of safe water\nand know how to keep it clean and free from germs. If the water is not clean\nit can be purified using low-cost solutions at home. It can be (1) boiled, (2)\ncleaned through a filter, (3) purified with chlorine or (4) disinfected with\nsunlight or other simple measures.10 The trained health worker or extension\nagent should have information on home treatments that are available locally.\n\nSafe water sources include properly constructed and maintained piped systems,\npublic standpipes, boreholes, pond sand filters, protected dug wells,\nprotected springs and rainwater collection. Water from unsafe sources -\nrivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams, canals, irrigation channels, unprotected\nwells and springs - is best avoided. If necessary it can be made safer by the\nhome-based water treatment methods referred to above. Water should be safely\nstored in a covered container that is clean on the inside and outside.\n\n**Families and communities can protect their water supply by:**\n\n  * lining and covering open wells, installing a handpump and protecting the immediate area from animals and vandalism\n  * protecting a spring with a spring box\n  * disposing of faeces and waste water (especially from latrines and household cleaning) well away from any water source used for cooking, drinking or washing\n  * building latrines at least 15 metres away and downhill from a water source\n  * always keeping jerry-cans, buckets, pitchers, ropes and jars used to collect and store water as clean as possible by storing them in a clean place, off the ground and away from animals\n  * keeping all animals away from drinking water sources and family living areas\n  * avoiding the use of pesticides or chemicals anywhere near a water source.\n\n**Families can keep water clean in the home by:**\n\n  * storing drinking water in a clean, covered container\n  * washing hands regularly - including before handling stored clean water\n  * taking water out of the container with a clean ladle or cup\n  * having a tap on the water container\n  * not allowing anyone to put their fingers or hands into the container or to drink directly from it\n  * keeping all animals away from stored water.\n\nIf there is uncertainty about the safety of the drinking water, local\nauthorities should be consulted.\n\n",
