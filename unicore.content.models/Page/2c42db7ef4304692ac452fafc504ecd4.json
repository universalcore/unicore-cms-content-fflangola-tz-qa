  "content": "Too many births, births too close together and births to adolescent girls\nunder 18 and women over 35 endanger the lives of women and adolescents and\ntheir infants. Family planning is one of the most effective ways to improve\nwomen's and children's health and survival. Family planning services provide\nwomen and men with information, education and the means to plan when to begin\nhaving children, how many to have, how far apart to have them and when to\nstop. However, millions of women of childbearing age, including adolescent\ngirls, do not have control over limiting pregnancies or spacing births, nor do\nthey have access to effective family planning methods. Both women and men have\nthe right to choose how many children to have and when to have them. With\nfamily planning services they are enabled to make informed decisions on\npregnancy by taking into account the benefits and risks, including those\nrelated to age and level of access to health services. Ensuring access to\nfamily planning services for women and men, and to education for all children\nwould help prevent many maternal and child deaths and disabilities,\nparticularly in countries where marriage occurs early in life. Together these\nmeasures can contribute to women's, adolescent girls' and children's right to\nsurvival, health and well-being.\n\n",
