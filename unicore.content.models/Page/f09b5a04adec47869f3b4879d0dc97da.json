Breastmilk helps protect a child against disease for as\nlong as the child breastfeeds. It is recommended that a mother continue to\nbreastfeed her child up to two years and beyond - as long as she and the child\nwish to continue. Breastfeeding can comfort a child who is upset and is an\nimportant source of nourishment during a child's illness.\n\n",
