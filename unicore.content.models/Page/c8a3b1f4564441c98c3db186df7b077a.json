  "content": "When children are sick, such as when they have diarrhoea, measles or\npneumonia, their appetite decreases and their body uses food less effectively.\nIf the child is sick several times a year, his or her growth will slow or\nstop.\n\nIt is very important to encourage a sick child to eat. This can be difficult,\nas children who are ill may not be hungry. The parent or other caregiver\nshould keep offering foods the child likes, a little at a time and as often as\npossible. Extra breastfeeding is especially important since it can provide\nnutrients required for recovery from infections.\n\nIt is essential to encourage a sick child to drink as often as possible.\nDehydration (lack of fluids in the body) is a serious problem for children\nwith diarrhoea. Drinking plenty of liquids will help prevent dehydration. When\na child has diarrhoea, giving him or her oral rehydration salts (ORS)\ndissolved in clean water, along with foods and liquids, can help prevent\ndehydration. Giving the child a zinc supplement every day for 10-14 days can\nreduce the severity of the diarrhoea. The child is not fully recovered from an\nillness until he or she weighs about as much as when the illness began.\n\nA child can die from persistent diarrhoea if it is not treated quickly. If\ndiarrhoea and poor appetite persist for more than a few days, the mother,\nfather or other caregiver needs to consult a trained health worker.\n\n([Refer to the Diarrhoea chapter for more information.](/about/diarrhoea/))\n\n",
