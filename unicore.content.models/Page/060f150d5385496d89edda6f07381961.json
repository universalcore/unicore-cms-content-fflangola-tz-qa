In some cases, however, coughs\nare danger signs of more serious illnesses, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis.\nPneumonia is the world's leading cause of death in girls and boys under age 5,\nclosely followed by diarrhoea. Around 2 million children die from pneumonia\nevery year. Pneumonia kills more children than AIDS, malaria and measles\ncombined. One out of every five deaths of children under age 5 is caused by\nthis respiratory infection. All girls and boys have the right to quality\nhealth care to make sure that respiratory infections and other illnesses are\naccurately diagnosed and treated before it is too late.\n\n",
