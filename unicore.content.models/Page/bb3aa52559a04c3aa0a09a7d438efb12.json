  "content": "Each year, over 1.4 million children die from diseases that are preventable\nwith readily available vaccines. These diseases include measles, meningitis\ncaused by Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis\n(whooping cough), yellow fever, polio and hepatitis B. New vaccines against\nother illnesses, such as pneumonia and diarrhoea caused by rotavirus, have\nbeen developed and are now more widely used. Children who are immunized are\nprotected from these dangerous diseases, which can often lead to disability or\ndeath. All children have the right to this protection. Every girl and boy\nneeds to be fully immunized. Early protection is critical. The immunizations\nin the child's first year and into the second year are especially important.\nIt is also essential that pregnant women are immunized against tetanus to\nprotect themselves as well as their newborns. Although there has been progress\nin the past years in immunizing children, in 2008 nearly 24 million children\n-- almost 20% of children born each year -- did not get the routine\nimmunizations scheduled for the first year of life. Parents or other\ncaregivers need to know why immunization is important, the recommended\nimmunization schedule, and where their children can be immunized. Parents or\nother caregivers need to know that it is safe to immunize a child who has a\nminor illness or a disability or is suffering from malnutrition.\n\n",
