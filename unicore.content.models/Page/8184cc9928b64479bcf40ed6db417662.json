  "content": "In most countries, children start primary school at around 6 or 7 years of\nage. Starting school is a critical stage in a child's development.\n\nBoth girls and boys should start school at the appropriate age (in accordance\nwith their country's policy). By the time they enter school, they should have\nbasic cognitive and language skills and sufficient social competency and\nemotional development to allow them to enjoy learning in the formal school\nsetting.\n\nThe support of parents and other caregivers is very important for children's\nsuccessful transition to school. Parents and other caregivers should equally\nand fully support both girls and boys in attending school regularly and being\nwell prepared. They should also be involved in school activities. This helps\nchildren adapt to the school setting, settle more quickly into the school\nlearning environment and attend school regularly.\n\nTeachers should be prepared to support young children who are still developing\ntheir basic potential for learning. Teachers have a key role in building the\nconfidence of both girls and boys so that they can equally enjoy and succeed\nat learning. Play continues to be a basic medium of teaching and learning in\nthe early school years. A child-friendly school that supports active learning\nand promotes participation offers the best learning environment for children.\n\nAlong with families and the school, the community - both local authorities and\ncivil society - can contribute to:\n\n  * making school a priority within the community\n  * making sure the school is a safe and welcoming place for all children\n  * making sure the school has the resources it needs, including community members involved in school management and parent-teacher associations.\n\n",
