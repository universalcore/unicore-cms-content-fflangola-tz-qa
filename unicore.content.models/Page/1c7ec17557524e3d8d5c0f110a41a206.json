  "content": "Cooking food thoroughly kills germs. Food, especially meat and poultry, should\nbe cooked all the way through. Germs grow quickly in warm food. Food should be\neaten as soon as possible after cooking so it does not have time to collect\ngerms. * If food has to be kept for more than two hours, it should be kept\neither very hot or very cool. * If cooked food is saved for another meal, it\nshould be covered to keep off flies and insects and then thoroughly reheated\nbefore being eaten. * Yogurt and sour porridge are good to use in the\npreparation of meals because their acid prevents the growth of germs. Raw\nfood, especially poultry and seafood, usually contains germs. Cooked food can\ncollect germs if it touches raw food, and these germs can breed in the cooked\nfood in a few hours. Raw and cooked foods should always be kept separate.\nKnives, chopping boards and surfaces should always be cleaned with soap and\nwater after preparing raw food. * Special care should be taken in preparing\nfood for infants and small children. Their food should be freshly made and\neaten immediately, not left standing. * Breastmilk is the safest (and most\nnutritious) milk for infants and young children. Expressed breastmilk can be\nstored at room temperature for up to eight hours in a clean, covered\ncontainer. If older children are given animal milk it should be freshly boiled\nor pasteurized (a special way of heating milk to destroy harmful bacteria). *\nAll poultry and poultry products should be cooked the whole way through to\nprevent the spread of avian influenza (bird flu). * Fruit and vegetables\nshould be peeled or washed thoroughly with clean water, especially if they are\nto be eaten raw by young children. Fruits and vegetables are often treated\nwith chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides, which can be harmful. *\nHands should be washed with soap and water after handling raw foods.\n\n",
