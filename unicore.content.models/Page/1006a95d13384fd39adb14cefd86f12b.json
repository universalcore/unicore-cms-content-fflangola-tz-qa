  "content": "Breastfeeding helps to protect babies from pneumonia and other illnesses. It\nis important to give breastmilk alone for the first six months of a baby's\nlife.\n\nAfter six months of age, a child should eat a variety of healthy foods and\ncontinue to breastfeed, to ensure that she or he gets the nutrients necessary\nto stay healthy and be less susceptible to respiratory infections and other\nillnesses. Some examples of healthy foods include fruits and vegetables\n(including green leafy vegetables), liver, red palm oil, dairy products, fish\nand eggs.\n\nSafe water and good hygiene practices help to reduce the number of respiratory\ninfections and other illnesses, such as diarrhoea. These practices include\nwashing vegetables and fruits, keeping food preparation surfaces clean, and\nwashing hands with soap and water or with a substitute, such as ash and water.\n\nEvery child should complete a recommended series of immunizations. Early\nprotection is critical; the immunizations in the first year and into the\nsecond year are especially important. The child will then be protected against\nmeasles, pertussis (whooping cough), tuberculosis and other respiratory\nillnesses, which can lead to pneumonia.\n\nParents and other caregivers should ensure that both girls and boys are\nequally provided with a varied and healthy diet and all immunizations. Health\nworkers can provide parents and other caregivers with information on diets,\nhygiene and immunizations and how they protect against pneumonia and other\nillnesses.\n\n",
