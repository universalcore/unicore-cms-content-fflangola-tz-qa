  "content": "Burning and scalding are among the most common causes of serious injury among\nyoung children. Burns often cause permanent scarring, and some are fatal. The\ngreat majority of these are preventable. **One of the most common types of\nburns is from direct contact with fires or flames or touching hot surfaces. To\nprevent this kind of burn:** * keep young children away from cooking fires,\nmatches, paraffin lamps, candles and flammable liquids such as paraffin and\nkerosene * put stoves on a flat, raised surface out of the reach of children *\nif an open cooking fire is used, make it on a raised mound of clay, not\ndirectly on the ground. A barrier of mud, bamboo or other material or a\nplaypen can also be used to keep young children out of reach of the cooking\nplace. * do not leave small children alone near fires or to tend fires or cook\n* keep children away from heaters, hot irons and other hot appliances * never\nleave a child alone in a room with a candle or fire burning. **Another major\ncause of burns is scalding from hot liquids or foods. To prevent scalds:** *\nturn the handles of all cooking pots away from the reach of children * keep\nhot foods and liquids in a safe place and out of children's reach * do not let\nchildren turn on the hot water tap in a bath or shower by themselves * keep\nthe temperature of water heaters below a medium setting to prevent scalding if\nchildren turn on the hot water * teach children not to play rough around\npeople with hot drinks or in the kitchen when meals are being prepared * never\nhold a child when having hot liquids or foods. **Children can get a serious\nshock or burn if they come in contact with electricity. To prevent shocks and\nburns:** * teach children never to put their fingers or other objects into\nelectric sockets * cover power sockets to prevent access * keep electric wires\nout of children's reach * cover bare electric wires, which are particularly\ndangerous, using insulating tape.
