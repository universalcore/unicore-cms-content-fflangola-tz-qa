  "content": "From a very early age, including during infancy, girls and boys form and\nexpress views and interests. As they grow so does their ability to participate\nin decisions that concern them and their families and communities. Children\nand adults should actively and consistently talk to each other, sharing\ninformation and ideas in the home, school and community. The exchange should\nbe based on mutual respect. Children's views should be listened to and taken\nseriously in accordance with the child's age and maturity. Girls and boys who\nexpress their opinions freely are more likely to assume responsibilities,\ndevelop critical thinking and communication skills, and make informed\ndecisions as they grow. They are often able to: * learn and perform better in\nschool * contribute to making responsible decisions regarding their education\nand health * protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections,\nincluding HIV, unwanted pregnancy, bullying, bias, discrimination, harassment,\nviolence, abuse and exploitation * learn and practise active citizenship and\ngrow into adults who will be ready to exercise their rights and\nresponsibilities. Children are avid users, producers and subjects of media, a\npowerful source for influencing opinion and perceptions among children.\nDifferent forms of media can be used responsibly to broaden children's\nknowledge, inform them on how to protect themselves and develop their\ncitizenship skills. Children-led associations or clubs can give girls and boys\na place to voice their ideas, perspectives and concerns. Such clubs provide an\nopportunity for them to socialize and develop their interests and leadership\nskills.\n\n",
