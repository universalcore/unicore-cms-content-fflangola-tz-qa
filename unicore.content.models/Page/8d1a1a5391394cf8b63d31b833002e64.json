  "content": "Birth registration provides an official record of a child's existence and\nnationality. It is considered a fundamental human right. A child without a\nbirth certificate can be denied health care, legal services, access to school\nand the right to vote upon reaching adulthood. Registering a child's birth is\na vital step towards her or his protection. Children under age 5 with a birth\ncertificate are more likely to be immunized and receive health care for\nchildhood illnesses, assuring them a healthy start in life. Any enforcement of\nminimum-age legislation depends upon an official record of a child's age. For\nexample, a birth certificate can be used to protect a child from illegal\nrecruitment by armed forces or armed groups, from child marriage or from\nhazardous forms of work. Birth registration should be free and accessible for\nevery child. Where it is not, civil society organizations can sometimes assist\nfamilies in registering their children. The birth registration process may be\nsupported by social services, such as health care and education. Health\ncentres and hospitals sometimes have civil registrars on site that can provide\na child's birth certificate at birth or during a health-care visit.\nRegistration sometimes takes place in early childhood education programmes.\n\n",
