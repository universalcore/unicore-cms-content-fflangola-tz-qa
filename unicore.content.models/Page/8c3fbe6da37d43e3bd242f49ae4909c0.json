  "content": "Landmines are victim-activated explosive devices intended to kill or injure\npeople or destroy or damage vehicles. Unexploded ordnance (called UXO) are any\nmunitions, such as bombs, shells, mortars or grenades, that were used but\nfailed to detonate as intended. Both landmines and UXO come in many different\nshapes, sizes and colours. They can be buried underground, placed above ground\nor hidden in grass, trees or water. They may be bright and shiny or dirty and\nrusty, but they are always dangerous and must be avoided at all times.\nLandmines are usually not visible. Special caution is needed near areas of\nmilitary action or abandoned or overgrown areas. Dangerous areas are often\ndesignated by a marking such as a picture of a skull and crossbones,\nredpainted stones or other common markings that draw attention and are easily\nrecognized as hazard warnings by the local population. UXO are often easier to\nsee than landmines. Their colour and shape make them attractive to children,\nbut they are extremely dangerous and unstable. They can explode with the\nslightest touch or change in temperature. They kill more often than do\nlandmines. Children should be taught not to touch unfamiliar objects. They\nneed to learn that if anything looks suspicious they should keep away and\ninform adults they know or the authorities. Since some roads may be mined or\nlittered with explosive remnants of war, it is important for families to ask\nlocal people which roads or paths are safe to travel. Generally it is safer to\ntravel on commonly used roads and paths. Places likely to have mines, UXO or\nabandoned weapons and ammunition include abandoned or destroyed buildings,\nunused paths or roads, untouched and overgrown fields, current or former\nmilitary bases, outposts, checkpoints, trenches or ditches. Children and their\nfamilies need to be informed to stay away from these areas. Measures should be\nput in place to keep them away. Children and their families need to learn what\nto do if they see a mine or UXO. They should: * stand still and tell others\nnearby to do the same * avoid panicking * avoid movement * call for help * if\nhelp does not come, carefully consider the options before moving to retrace\nthe original steps backwards very slowly. If a landmine or UXO injury occurs:\n* apply firm pressure to the bleeding area until the bleeding stops * if the\nbleeding is not stopping, tie a cloth or piece of clothing (a tourniquet) just\nabove or as close to the wound as possible and send for medical assistance *\nif help is delayed more than one hour, loosen the tourniquet hourly to check\nthe bleeding; remove the tourniquet when the bleeding stops * if the person is\nbreathing but unconscious, roll the person onto his or her side so the tongue\ndoes not block breathing * seek follow-up medical care, as needed. Governments\nand local authorities have the responsibility to make communities safe for all\nchildren and families. Professional demining is the best solution to ensure\nthe safety of all.\n\n",
