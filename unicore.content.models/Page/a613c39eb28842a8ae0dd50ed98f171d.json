  "content": "It is normal for children's feelings and behaviours to be affected by\nfrightening, painful or violent experiences. Children react differently - they\nmay lose interest in daily life, become more aggressive or turn very fearful.\nSome children who appear to be coping well are hiding their emotions and\nfears. **Parents or regular caregivers, peers, teachers and community members\nare an important source of support and security for children. Families and\ncommunities can help children if they:** * listen to both girls and boys and\nprovide them opportunities to express their concerns, participate in decision-\nmaking and find solutions * provide children with age-appropriate information,\nreassurance and emotional support * maintain familiar routines in daily life\nand resume normal activities as soon as possible * provide enjoyable age-\nappropriate activities for children such as cultural activities, visits to\nfriends and families, and sports * encourage children to continue to play and\nsocialize with others * provide children with age-appropriate opportunities to\nparticipate in meaningful ways in everyday activities and in the emergency\nresponse, such as assisting with teaching and caring for young children *\nmaintain clear rules for acceptable behaviour and avoid physical punishment *\nprovide safe spaces where children and parents can socialize, learn life\nskills and access basic services * help children learn how to manage their\nstress. When children's stress reactions are severe and last for a long time,\nthey need help from a qualified professional such as a counsellor,\npsychologist or specialized nurse or doctor.\n\n",
