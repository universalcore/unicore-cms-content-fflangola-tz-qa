  "content": "Many parents do not take a child to be immunized because the child has a\nfever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However, it is safe to\nimmunize a child who has a minor illness. It is also safe to immunize a child\nwho has a disability or is malnourished. If a child is HIV-positive or\nsuspected to be HIV-positive, a trained health worker should be consulted\nabout which vaccines to give the child. After an injection, the child may cry\nor develop a fever, a minor rash or a small sore. This is normal and shows\nthat the vaccine is working. Children under 6 months of age should breastfeed\nfrequently; older children should be given plenty of liquids and foods. If the\nchild develops a high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius) the child should be\ntaken to a trained health worker or health centre. Measles can be extremely\ndangerous for malnourished children, so they should be immunized against\nmeasles, especially if the malnutrition is severe.\n\n",
