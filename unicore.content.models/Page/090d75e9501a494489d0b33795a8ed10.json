Babies can be born with low birthweight, which can affect their health\nand survival. Health workers, families and communities should be aware of\nthese dangers, provide protection, and work to prevent and eliminate violence\nagainst women. Local authorities, with support from organizations and\ncommunity leaders, have the responsibility to: 1) take action to prevent\nviolence against women and challenge social norms that increase women's risk\nfor violence and abuse; 2) enforce laws protecting women from violence and\nabuse; and 3) provide accessible protection and support services for abused\nwomen.\n\n",
