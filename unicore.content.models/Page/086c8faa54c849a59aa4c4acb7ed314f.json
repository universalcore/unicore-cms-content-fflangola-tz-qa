Wash plates, utensils and pans\nimmediately after eating and put them on a rack to dry * keep food in clean,\ncovered containers to protect it from insects and animals * do not use feeding\nbottles or teats, because they may contain germs that cause diarrhoea.\nBreastfeed, or feed children from a clean, open cup. If bottles/teats are\nused, clean them after each use with boiling water.\n\n",
