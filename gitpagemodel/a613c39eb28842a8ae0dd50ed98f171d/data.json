        "content": "It is normal for children's feelings and behaviours to be affected by\nfrightening, painful or violent experiences. Children react differently - they\nmay lose interest in daily life, become more aggressive or turn very fearful.\nSome children who appear to be coping well are hiding their emotions and\nfears.\n\n**Parents or regular caregivers, peers, teachers and community members are an important source of support and security for children. Families and communities can help children if they:**\n\n  * listen to both girls and boys and provide them opportunities to express their concerns, participate in decision-making and find solutions\n  * provide children with age-appropriate information, reassurance and emotional support\n  * maintain familiar routines in daily life and resume normal activities as soon as possible\n  * provide enjoyable age-appropriate activities for children such as cultural activities, visits to friends and families, and sports\n  * encourage children to continue to play and socialize with others\n  * provide children with age-appropriate opportunities to participate in meaningful ways in everyday activities and in the emergency response, such as assisting with teaching and caring for young children\n  * maintain clear rules for acceptable behaviour and avoid physical punishment\n  * provide safe spaces where children and parents can socialize, learn life skills and access basic services\n  * help children learn how to manage their stress.\n\nWhen children's stress reactions are severe and last for a long time, they\nneed help from a qualified professional such as a counsellor, psychologist or\nspecialized nurse or doctor.\n\n",
