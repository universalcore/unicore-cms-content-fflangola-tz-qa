Household waste water can be disposed of\nsafely by making a soak pit or a channel to the kitchen garden or to the\nfield.\n\nChemicals such as pesticides and herbicides can be very dangerous if even\nsmall quantities get into the water supply or onto food, hands or feet.\nClothes and containers used when handling chemicals should not be washed near\na household water source.\n\nPesticides and other chemicals should not be used around the household or near\na water source. Chemicals should not be stored in or near drinking water\ncontainers or near food. Never store food or water in pesticide or fertilizer\ncontainers.\n\n",
