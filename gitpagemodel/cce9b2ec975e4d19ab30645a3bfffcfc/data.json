They\nneed to know how to give emotional, mental and spiritual support to students\nand guide families on how to do the same with their children.\n\nSchools and communities can also help to organize fun activities for children\noutside of school time. Opportunities can be created for organized non-violent\nplay, sports and other forms of recreation. Communication and interaction\namong peers should be encouraged and supported. Use of arts such as drawing,\nor playing with toys or puppets, can help young children express their\nconcerns and adjust to stressful experiences.\n\nParents and other caregivers should keep children who become sick with the flu\nor other infectious disease at home or in their place of residence if\ndisplaced from their homes.\n\nIn case of a severe epidemic that spreads rapidly from person to person, local\nauthorities and education personnel need to make appropriate decisions\nregarding how to protect children. As a public health measure, classes may be\nsuspended to reduce spread of the disease. In such cases, education can still\ncontinue by using alternative strategies. This requires good planning and\nfollow-up by education personnel in collaboration with the students' families.\n\n",
