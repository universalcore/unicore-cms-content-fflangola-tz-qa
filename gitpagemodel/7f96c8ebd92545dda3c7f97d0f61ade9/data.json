        "content": "Pregnant women are more likely to suffer from malaria than other women. The\ndisease is more dangerous during pregnancy, especially during the first\npregnancy. This is due to changes in a woman's body that lower her previous\nlevel of resistance to malaria. Malaria can cause severe anaemia ('thin\nblood'), miscarriage, premature birth or stillbirth.\n\nBabies born to mothers who have had malaria during pregnancy are often\nunderweight. This makes them more vulnerable to infection or death during\ntheir first year.\n\nWomen in their first pregnancy in areas where malaria is prevalent often do\nnot show the typical signs of malaria.\n\nAs preventive treatment, pregnant women in malarial areas, especially those in\ntheir first pregnancy, who can be asymptomatic (without symptoms), should take\nantimalarial tablets in the second and third trimesters, as recommended by a\ntrained health worker. The health worker will know which antimalarial tablets\nare best to take.\n\nIt is also very important that pregnant women sleep under insecticide-treated\nmosquito nets.\n\nPregnant women with signs and symptoms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria must\nbe treated immediately by a trained health worker with quinine in the first\ntrimester and ACTs in the second and third trimesters.\n\n",
