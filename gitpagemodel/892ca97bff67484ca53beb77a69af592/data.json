Children should be immunized at the recommended ages and should\nreceive subsequent doses at recommended intervals.\n\nWhen a child is immunized, the health worker should record the vaccine, which\ndose it is (first, second, etc.) and the date on an immunization or health\ncard given to the parents or other caregiver. The immunizations should also be\nrecorded and kept at the health clinic. It is important for the parents or\nother caregiver to keep the immunization card and bring it with them the next\ntime the child is vaccinated. With it, the health worker can record which\nvaccines the child has received and the date they were given. The healh worker\ncan also provide information to the parents or other caregiver on vaccines\nthat are missing or remaining.\n\n",
