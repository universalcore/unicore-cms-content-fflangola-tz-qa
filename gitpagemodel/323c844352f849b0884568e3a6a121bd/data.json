        "content": "Child development refers to the changes that occur as a child grows and\ndevelops in relation to being physically healthy, mentally alert, emotionally\nsound, socially competent and ready to learn.\n\nThe first five years of a child's life are fundamentally important. They are\nthe foundation that shapes children's future health, happiness, growth,\ndevelopment and learning achievement at school, in the family and community,\nand in life in general.\n\nRecent research confirms that the first five years are particularly important\nfor the development of the child's brain, and the first three years are the\nmost critical in shaping the child's brain architecture. Early experiences\nprovide the base for the brain's organizational development and functioning\nthroughout life. They have a direct impact on how children develop learning\nskills as well as social and emotional abilities.\n\nChildren learn more quickly during their early years than at any other time in\nlife. They need love and nurturing to develop a sense of trust and security\nthat turns into confidence as they grow.\n\nBabies and young children grow, learn and develop rapidly when they receive\nlove and affection, attention, encouragement and mental stimulation, as well\nas nutritious meals and good health care.\n\nUnderstanding the stages of child development helps parents know what to\nexpect and how to best support the child as she or he grows and develops.\n\nIn many settings, early childhood programmes support parents and their\nchildren from infancy through age 8, which includes the important transition\nfrom home to school.\n\nAll children have the right to be raised in a family and to have access to\nquality health care, good nutrition, education, play and protection from harm,\nabuse and discrimination. Children have the right to grow up in an environment\nin which they are enabled to reach their full potential in life.\n\nIt is the duty of parents, other caregivers and family members, communities,\ncivil society and governments to ensure that these rights are respected,\nprotected and fulfilled.\n\n",
