        "content": "Infectious diseases spread easily in crowded emergency conditions. To reduce\nthe risks:\n\n  * ensure that all children 6 months to 15 years of age are appropriately immunized, especially against measles, at the first point of contact or settlement\n  * continue to seek health-care services to prevent and treat illnesses.\n\n(Refer to the chapters on [Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health](/content/detail\n/why-it-is-important-1/), [Immunizations](/content/detail/why-it-is-\nimportant-5/); [Coughs, Colds and More Serious Illnesses](/content/detail/why-\nit-is-important-6/), and [Malaria](/content/detail/why-it-is-important-to-\nshare-and-act-on-this-information/).)\n\nMalnutrition is more common in emergencies due to shortages of food, increased\ndisease and disruption of caring practices. It is therefore important to\nensure that children:\n\n  * breastfeed and receive adequate amounts of age-appropriate nutritious foods and drinks\n  * receive micronutrient supplements in addition to fortified foods.\n\nChildren who are very thin and/or swollen (usually the feet and legs) need to\nbe taken to a trained health worker or health facility for immediate\nassessment and treatment and further management in accordance with their\nstatus.\n\n(Refer to the chapters on [Breastfeeding](/content/detail/why-it-is-\nimportant-3/) and [Nutrition and Growth](/content/detail/why-it-is-\nimportant-4/).)\n\nn emergencies, lack of safe water, sanitation and hygiene can cause disease\nthat may turn into an epidemic. Cholera can occur where there is poor\nsanitation and overcrowding. Basic steps to follow include:\n\n  * continue to wash hands frequently with soap and water or a substitute, such as ash and water\n  * dispose of faeces and garbage safely\n  * practise safe food preparation\n  * use safe water sources or employ home-based water treatment, such as boiling, filtering, adding chlorine or disinfecting with sunlight\n  * store safe water in clean, covered containers.\n\n(Refer to the chapters on [Hygiene](/about/hygiene/) and\n[Diarrhoea](/about/diarrhoea/).)\n\n",
