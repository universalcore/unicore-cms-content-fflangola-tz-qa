        "content": "In most countries, children start primary school at around 6 or 7 years of\nage. Starting school is a critical stage in a child's development. Both girls\nand boys should start school at the appropriate age (in accordance with their\ncountry's policy). By the time they enter school, they should have basic\ncognitive and language skills and sufficient social competency and emotional\ndevelopment to allow them to enjoy learning in the formal school setting. The\nsupport of parents and other caregivers is very important for children's\nsuccessful transition to school. Parents and other caregivers should equally\nand fully support both girls and boys in attending school regularly and being\nwell prepared. They should also be involved in school activities. This helps\nchildren adapt to the school setting, settle more quickly into the school\nlearning environment and attend school regularly. Teachers should be prepared\nto support young children who are still developing their basic potential for\nlearning. Teachers have a key role in building the confidence of both girls\nand boys so that they can equally enjoy and succeed at learning. Play\ncontinues to be a basic medium of teaching and learning in the early school\nyears. A child-friendly school that supports active learning and promotes\nparticipation offers the best learning environment for children. Along with\nfamilies and the school, the community - both local authorities and civil\nsociety - can contribute to: * making school a priority within the community *\nmaking sure the school is a safe and welcoming place for all children * making\nsure the school has the resources it needs, including community members\ninvolved in school management and parent-teacher associations.\n\n",
