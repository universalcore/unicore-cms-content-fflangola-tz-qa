        "content": "Adolescent and pre-adolescent girls need to be informed about the significance\nof menstruation in relation to reproduction and the importance of menstrual\nhygiene. They need information on how to care for and clean themselves when\nthey are menstruating. Boys should also learn about menstruation and be aware\nof girls' particular hygiene needs. Hygienic menstruation practices among\nadolescent girls and women should be promoted and supported. * Clean and dry\nfeminine hygiene products such as cloths or napkins should be available. Where\ncloths are used it is important that they are regularly washed with soap and\nwater and dried fully in the sun before the next use. Damp cloths can carry\ngerms that can lead to infections. Used sanitary napkins should be disposed of\nin a refuse pit or collected and burned. * Water and soap should be provided\nin a private place (bathing area, latrine) for girls and women to wash during\nmenstruation and for washing their hands after changing their cloth/napkin.\nPoor menstruation hygiene can lead to fungal infections. Repeated infections\ncan lead to serious reproductive tract infections. These could cause\ninfertility. * Schools should have separate latrines for girls and boys. The\ngirls' latrine in particular needs access to water and soap so girls can clean\nthemselves. Latrines that are private, clean and safe contribute to keeping\ngirls in school longer, which can delay early marriage and pregnancy. When\ngirls and women are menstruating, their privacy needs to be respected.\n\n",
