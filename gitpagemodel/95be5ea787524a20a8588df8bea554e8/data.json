To prevent children from drowning,\nparents and other caregivers should always closely supervise children who are\nnear or in the water.'\n\n**Where there is water, it is important to:**\n\n  * cover wells and water tanks so children cannot open them\n  * turn tubs and buckets upside down when not in use, and always supervise children taking a bath\n  * teach children to stay away from ditches and drains\n  * for families who live near bodies of water, install a fence around the house and close the gates to prevent young children from going in the water\n  * fence ponds and pools with vertical rails spaced close together to prevent children from getting through them to the water\n  * for families who live directly on the water, put vertical bars on terraces, windows and doors to prevent young children from falling in the water\n  * teach children how to swim when they are young\n  * have young children and children who cannot swim wear an approved flotation device (life jacket) when playing in the water or on a boat\n  * always supervise children who are swimming\n  * teach children never to swim in fast-flowing streams and never to swim alone\n  * in flood-prone areas, carefully watch children when the water begins to rise; make sure that all family members, including children old enough to understand, are well informed of safe places to go to if they need to leave the home quickly.\n\n[For first aid advice on cuts and wounds, refer to the end of this\nchapter](/content/detail/first-aid-advice/)\n\n",
