        "content": "More than one third of all child deaths every year around the world are\nattributed to malnutrition, specifically undernutrition, which weakens the\nbody's resistance to illness.\n\nIf a woman is malnourished during pregnancy or if her child is malnourished\nduring the first two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and\ndevelopment will be slowed. This cannot be corrected when the child is older -\nit will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.\n\nMalnutrition develops when the body does not get the proper amount of energy\n(calories), proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals and other\nnutrients required to keep the organs and tissues healthy and functioning\nwell. A child or adult can be malnourished by being undernourished or\novernourished.\n\nIn most parts of the world malnutrition occurs when people are undernourished.\nPrimary reasons for undernourishment, especially of children and women, are\npoverty, lack of food, repeated illnesses, inappropriate feeding practices,\nlack of care and poor hygiene. Undernourishment raises the risk of\nmalnutrition. The risk is greatest in the first two years of life. The risk\nfurther increases when diarrhoea and other illnesses sap the body of the\nproteins, minerals and nutrients required to stay healthy.\n\nWhen a household does not have enough food and has conditions that make\ndiarrhoea and other illnesses common, children are the most vulnerable to\nbecoming malnourished. When children become sick, they lose energy and\nnutrients quickly, which puts their lives at risk faster than adults.\n\nOvernutrition is when a person is overweight or obese. It can cause diabetes\nin childhood and cardiovascular disease and other diseases in adulthood.\nSometimes children eat large quantities of foods that are high in energy but\nnot rich in other necessary nutrients, such as sugary drinks or fried, starchy\nfoods. In such cases improving the quality of the child's diet is crucial\nalong with increasing his or her level of physical activity.\n\nChildren with chronic diseases, such as HIV, are even more susceptible to\nmalnutrition. Their bodies have a harder time absorbing vitamins, iron and\nother nutrients. Children with disabilities may need extra attention to make\nsure they get the nutrition they need.\n\nAll girls and boys have the right to a caring and protective environment, with\nmothers, fathers or other caregivers making sure they are well nourished with\na healthy diet.\n\n",
