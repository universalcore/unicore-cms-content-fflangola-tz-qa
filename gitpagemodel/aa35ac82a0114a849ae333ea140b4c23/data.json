        "content": "Placing children who have committed crimes or have been accused of committing\ncrimes in a detention centre, prison or reform school or any other closed\nsetting should always be a last resort. Detention can be detrimental to\nchildren's development and make reintegration into society more difficult.\nAlternatives such as mediation, community service and counselling produce\nbetter results for children and their families and communities. Such\nalternatives are generally more respectful of children's rights and help\nchildren learn how to take on a more constructive role in society. This should\nbe the objective of all justice interventions concerning children. The\nmajority of children in detention have not committed a serious offence. They\nare often detained for dropping out of school, running away from home, using\nalcohol, begging or vagrancy. Some children are in detention because they have\nbeen exploited by adults through prostitution or drug dealing. Children can\nremain in detention for months or years awaiting review of their case. These\nchildren are at higher risk of violence and exposure to drugs, HIV infection\nand other health problems. Detention can interrupt their schooling and\ndistance them from family. Children in detention generally need a social\nprotection response, not a judicial one. **Children who are in detention\nshould:** * be separated from adult offenders * have their cases addressed\nwithin a short time frame * be separated by gender * have appropriate means to\nreport violence committed against them while in detention. Pregnant women and\nmothers with children in detention need special protection, care and support.\nAll children in these circumstances are entitled to protection of their\nrights, such as access to health care and education. **Child-sensitive\nprocedures for boys and girls should be put in place for child victims and\nwitnesses of crime. Such procedures should:** * prevent contact between the\nchild and the alleged perpetrator (the person who is accused of committing the\ncrime) * allow for the child's full participation in the justice process *\nensure that the child is treated with dignity and compassion.\n\n",
