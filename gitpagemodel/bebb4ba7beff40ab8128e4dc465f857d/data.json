        "content": "Breastmilk is the best food a young child can have. It promotes optimal growth\nand development and protects against illness. Breastmilk contains the perfect\nbalance of nutrients for a baby, unlike infant formula, powdered milk or\nanimal milk.\n\nThe baby does not need water or other drinks or foods (such as tea, juice,\nsugar water, gripe water, rice water, other milks, formula or porridge) during\nthe first six months. Even in hot, dry climates, breastmilk fully meets a\nbaby's need for fluids.\n\nBreastmilk is easy for the baby to digest. A baby has difficulty digesting\nanimal milks, and formula is digested much more slowly than breastmilk.\nCompared to other options, breastmilk nourishes the baby more efficiently.\n\nBreastmilk protects against illness because it contains antibodies that\ntransfer the mother's immunity or resistance to disease to the child. No other\nmilks contain these antibodies.\n\nGiving a baby under 6 months of age any liquids or foods other than breastmilk\nincreases the risk of diarrhoea and other illnesses. Water and other liquids\nor foods may be contaminated, which can cause diarrhoea.\n\nA baby who takes water or other liquids or foods in the first six months\nsuckles less on the breast. This slows down breastmilk production.\n\nIf regular weighing shows that a breastfed baby under 6 months of age is not\ngrowing well:\n\n  * The mother may need help to improve the way the baby takes the breast into the mouth to ensure good attachment so the baby can suckle effectively.\n  * The baby may need more opportunities to breastfeed. The baby should breastfeed on demand, day and night, at least eight times during a 24-hour period. The baby should be allowed to breastfeed until she or he releases the breast and looks satisfied and sleepy. This shows that the baby has had all she or he wants from that breast. The baby should then be offered the other breast and may or may not want it. The baby should be kept on the breast until she or he has finished suckling.\n  * A low-birthweight baby may need frequent pauses during breastfeeding.\n  * The baby may be ill and should be checked by a trained health worker.\n  * The baby may be getting water or other fluids, which can reduce the intake of breastmilk. The mother may need guidance on how to reduce and eliminate other fluids and to increase and give only breastmilk.\n\nFeeding a baby only with breastmilk and on demand during the first six months\ncan help to delay the return of the mother's menstruation. This may help to\ndelay the next pregnancy. However, there is some possibility - less than 2 per\ncent - that a mother can become pregnant before her periods return. This\nbecomes increasingly likely after six months.\n\n",
