        "content": "Breastmilk is the best source of liquid and food for a young child with\ndiarrhoea. It is nutritious and clean and helps fight illness and infections.\nAn infant who is fed only breastmilk in her or his first six months of life is\nless likely to get diarrhoea during this time.\n\nBreastmilk prevents dehydration and malnutrition and helps replace lost\nfluids. Mothers are sometimes advised to give less breastmilk if a child has\ndiarrhoea. This advice is wrong. Mothers should breastfeed more often than\nusual when the child has diarrhoea. Fathers should support mothers who are\nbreastfeeding by caring for the sick child and other children in the family,\nand by helping with household tasks.\n\nRotavirus causes diarrhoea. Children should be immunized against rotavirus in\ncountries that offer this vaccination.\n\nVitamin A supplementation, particularly in areas deficient in vitamin A, is an\nimportant measure to reduce the risk of diarrhoea. Foods that contain vitamin\nA include breastmilk, liver, fish, dairy products, orange or yellow fruits and\nvegetables, and green leafy vegetables.\n\nIncluding zinc as part of the treatment for diarrhoea for 10-14 days helps to\nreduce its severity and duration, and also protects the child from future\ndiarrhoea episodes for up to two months. Children over 6 months of age can\ntake 20 milligrams per day of zinc (tablet or syrup). For children under 6\nmonths, 10 milligrams per day (tablet or syrup) is an appropriate amount.\n\nThe trained health worker should show the mother, father or other caregiver\nhow to give the child a zinc tablet by dissolving it in a small amount of\nexpressed breastmilk, ORS or clean water in a small cup or spoon. If the child\nis too young for a tablet, zinc syrup can be used.\n\n",
