Pneumonia is the world's leading cause of\ndeath in girls and boys under age 5, closely followed by diarrhoea. Around 2\nmillion children die from pneumonia every year. Pneumonia kills more children\nthan AIDS, malaria and measles combined. One out of every five deaths of\nchildren under age 5 is caused by this respiratory infection.\n\nAll girls and boys have the right to quality health care to make sure that\nrespiratory infections and other illnesses are accurately diagnosed and\ntreated before it is too late.\n\n",
