        "content": "Good nutrition in the first two years of life is crucial. Inadequate nutrition\nduring this period can slow a child's physical and mental development for the\nrest of his or her life.\n\nIn order to grow and stay healthy, young children need a variety of nutritious\nfoods such as meat, fish, pulses, grains, eggs, fruits and vegetables, as well\nas breastmilk.\n\nA child's stomach is smaller than an adult's, so a child cannot eat as much at\none meal. However, children's energy and body-building needs are great. It is\nimportant that children eat frequently to provide for all their needs.\n\nFoods such as mashed vegetables and chopped meat, eggs or fish should be added\nto the child's diet as often as possible. A small amount of oil may be added,\npreferably vitamin-enriched oil.\n\nIf meals are served in a common dish, younger children may not get enough\nfood. Giving a young child his or her own plate or bowl makes it easier for\nthe parent or other caregiver to know what foods and how much the child has\neaten.\n\nYoung children may need to be encouraged to eat, and they may need help in\nhandling food or utensils. A child with a developmental delay or disability\nmay need extra help eating and drinking.\n\n**The following gives information on how often and how much a young child should be fed:**\n\n**6-8 months:**\n\nChildren should breastfeed frequently and receive other foods two to three\ntimes a day. Parents should start with soft or mushy foods (such as porridge)\nand gradually increase the consistency (thickness) of food. Animal foods such\nas meat, eggs and fish can be given as early as possible, but they should be\nmashed, minced or cut into very small pieces. Start with 2-3 spoonfuls per\nfeeding, increasing gradually to 1/2 of a 250-millilitre cup.\n\n**9-24 months:**\n\nChildren should receive other foods three to four times a day in addition to\nbreastfeeding. Give infants aged 9-11 months 1/2 of a 250-millilitre cup per\nfeeding. Provide children aged 12-23 months 3/4 to 1 whole 250-millilitre cup\nper feeding. Give children 2 years and older at least 1 whole 250-millilitre\ncup per feeding. Foods from animals, such as meat, fish and eggs, should be\nincluded as much as possible.\n\n**By 12 months:**\n\nMost children are able to consume 'family foods' of a solid consistency. They\ncan still be offered semi-solid foods, which are easier for young children to\neat. Additional nutritious snacks (such as fruit, bread or bread with nut\npaste) can be offered once or twice per day, as desired, starting at six\nmonths. If the quality or amount of food per meal is low, or the child is no\nlonger breastfeeding, give 1-2 cups of milk plus one or two extra meals each\nday.\n\n",
