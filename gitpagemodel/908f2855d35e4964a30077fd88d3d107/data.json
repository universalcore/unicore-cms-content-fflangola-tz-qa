        "content": "Children may be hurt when they are crossing or walking along roads, or if they\nplay near roads. Young children do not think before they run onto the road.\n\n**Families need to:**\n\n  * watch children carefully\n  * fence the house and close the gate to prevent young children from running onto the road\n  * teach young children never to cross or walk along a road unless accompanied by an adult or older child\n  * prevent children from playing near the road\n  * teach children not to run after balls, moving toys or kites that go on or near the road\n  * instruct children to walk on the side of the road, facing traffic\n  * if there is a sidewalk, teach children to use it rather than walk on the road.\n\n**When crossing the road, young children should be taught to:**\n\n  * stop at the side of the road\n  * look both ways\n  * listen for cars or other vehicles before crossing\n  * hold the hand of another person\n  * walk, not run\n  * in urban areas, use pedestrian crossings\n  * avoid crossing the road at a curve or between parked cars\n  * avoid crossing roads with high-speed traffic.\n\nChildren are also at high risk of serious injury if they travel in the front\nseat of a car, unsupervised on the bed of a truck or agricultural machinery,\nor on a motorcycle.\n\nIn a car, children should use an age-appropriate child restraint or a booster\nseat until they are 150 centimetres tall or 10 years old, when they are big\nenough to use an adult seat belt.\n\nWhile travelling with parents or other caregivers on a motorbike, all\npassengers, including children, should wear a helmet that is securely strapped\nunder the chin so it cannot come off in case of an accident.\n\nBicycle accidents are a frequent cause of injury and death among children. All\nchildren should learn road safety and wear a bicycle helmet when riding a\nbike.\n\n[For first aid advice on cuts and wounds, refer to the end of this\nchapter](/content/detail/first-aid-advice/)\n\n",
